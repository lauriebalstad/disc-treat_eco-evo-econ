**Abstract:** Mitigating negative downstream impacts of disease in domestic settings is difficult: treatment is often expensive, and frequent treatment can lead to resistance evolution. As a result, managers in some systems treat in discrete pulses once a pre-defined parasite burden is reached. This discrete treatment application might moderate evolutionary, ecological, and economic outcomes, but has been largely ignored by past work. We create a model which unifies past theoretical work while incorporating discrete, threshold based treatment and host movement patterns which mimic the sea lice-salmon system. We decompose treatment into treatment frequency and treatment efficacy, allowing us to better understand management trade-offs between evolutionary, ecological, and economic outcomes. We find that moderate treatment thresholds, similar to those currently used in many salmon aquaculture systems, lead to rapid resistance evolution, even in the presence of large refuge lice populations. Our model shows that economic and conservation win-wins are possible: there are treatment thresholds choices which lead to relatively high link population sizes and relatively low economic losses, especially when treatment is very effective or treatment is cheap. However, positive evolutionary outcomes are harder to capture, and occur more often when treatment efficacy is low. Capturing positive economic, evolutionary, and conservation outcomes might require management action beyond regulation of lice treatment threshold and minimum treatment efficacy.
